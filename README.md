# Time-To-Market Modeling and Chip Agility Score (CAS)

In this repo you (will) find relevant datasets used in our time-to-market model and chip agility score calculations in our [Supply Chain Aware Computer Architecture](https://parallel.princeton.edu/papers/ning-supply-chain-isca-2023-preprint.pdf) paper to be presented at ISCA 2023. We hope to have these up by the time of publication.

In the mean time, please check out our preprint, and reach out if you have any questions!
